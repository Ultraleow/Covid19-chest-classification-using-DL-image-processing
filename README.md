1.Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has been gripping much of the world recently. Although
there have been much efforts gone into developing affordable testing for the masses, it has
been shown that the established and widely available chest x-rays (CXR) may be used as a
screening criterion. There are many dedicated works by various individuals and
organizations, publicly available chest x-rays of COVID-19 subjects are available for analytic
usage. The 3rd Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Summer/Winter School (DLAI3) is
glad to offer such an opportunity for aspiring researchers and hobbyists to test their skill in
this area.

This challenge is a continuation from the CSC532 Machine Learning course projects
from the School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology
Thonburi (KMUTT), which provided the mini-dataset and the dataset of annotated CXR
images.

The idea for using the CXR data is to determine weather the patient admitted is
positive or negative in covid-19. There is study found that one of the covid-19 symptom is
having clouded formation in the lung and causes difficult in breathing. Since this is a binary
output, we treat it as a classification problem. I combine both image processing technique
and deep learning method in order to produce a more accurate and more performance
outcome. Image processing technique can enhance the feature so that deep learning model
can be learn faster.
